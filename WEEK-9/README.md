Course: CST1510 - CW2 - Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

## Project Description
Built an interactive web dashboard using Streamlit to visualize and interact with multi-domain intelligence data. This project enhances Week 8’s database backend by providing a user-friendly front-end for data exploration, real-time filtering, and dynamic visualization.

## Features
-Developed a single-page and multipage Streamlit dashboard for cyber_incidents, datasets_metadata, and IT tickets.

-Implemented interactive widgets (dropdowns, sliders, checkboxes) for filtering and selecting data dynamically.

-Visualized data using charts and tables, including bar charts, line charts, and data tables.

-Incorporated real-time data retrieval from the SQLite database created in Week 8.

-Designed a modular and reusable code structure for scalability and maintainability.

-Added user interface elements such as headers, sidebars, and sections for better navigation and readability.

-Tested dashboard functionality with realistic queries and dataset interactions.

## Technical Implementation

-Frontend Framework: Streamlit

-Programming Language: Python 3.x

-Libraries: streamlit, pandas, sqlite3, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn (optional for advanced charts)

-Data Handling: Dynamic retrieval from SQLite database; filtered and aggregated in real-time

-Security & Usability: Input validation and modular design for future extension
