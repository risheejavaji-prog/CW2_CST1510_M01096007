Course: CST1510 - CW2 - Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

## Project Description
Transitioned from file-based storage (users.txt) to a professional database system using SQLite. This project implements a robust database layer to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and delete data for multiple domains.

## Features
-Migrated Week-7 users from users.txt to SQLite database

-Created database tables for three domains: cyber_incidents, datasets_metadata, it_tickets

-Loaded CSV data into the database using pandas

-Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Python functions

-Secured queries using parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection

-Tested the database with real-world queries

## Technical Implementation
-Database: SQLite (file-based, persistent storage)

-Programming Language: Python 3.x

-Libraries: sqlite3, pandas

-Security: Parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection

-Data Handling: Migrated data from text files and loaded CSVs into tables

-CRUD Operations: Implemented as Python functions for modular usage
