Course: CST1510 - CW2 - Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform  


## Project Description
Developed a multi-domain AI chatbot application using the **Groq API** and **Streamlit**.  
This project builds on earlier labs by integrating secure API usage, interactive console chat, and a web-based assistant with domain-specific expertise. The chatbot supports real-time conversations, domain selection, and streaming responses for a natural user experience.



## Features
- Implemented **basic API call** to Groq for chatbot responses.  
- Built an **interactive console chatbot** with memory for multi-turn conversations.  
- Created a **Streamlit session demo** to showcase chat input and message handling.  
- Developed a **multi-domain Streamlit app** with a sidebar selector for Cybersecurity, Data Science, and IT Operations.  
- Added **domain-specific system prompts** to tailor assistant behavior.  
- Enhanced the app with **streaming responses**, allowing real-time word-by-word output.  
- Ensured **secure API key management** using .env and gitignore.  
- Tested functionality across all four lab milestones with realistic queries.  



## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit  
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**: groq, streamlit, python-dotenv  
- **Data Handling**: Session state for chat history,domain-specific system prompts  
- **Security & Usability**: Environment variables for API keys, .gitignore for sensitive files, modular file structure
